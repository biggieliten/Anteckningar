When youÂ´ve loaded the page you will be faced with two sections, one on the left and one on the right. The right one is for creating and searching notes, and the left one is where the notes are displayed.
The usage is pretty straight forward, in the input fields you can see what to put where. To post a note you have to add a username, title and of course the note it self. The API can only receive notes where
the title and note is a minimum of 5 charachters. 

To post a note you fill the inputs and press the arrow button, now you will be able to see your note in the left section. To search a note you only need to add a username and press the "Search" button.
You can also edit your notes. Navigate to the left and check for a thin border around your note, thats where the input field is for editing. Now just click on the existing note and edit as needed. When done you press the
"Save" button.

Deleting the note is straight fowrard, you just press the "Delete" button.
